## Project Description
Our ongoing project aims to create a website facilitating the exchange of goods and services among students. While not yet complete, the platform will allow users to post advertisements for items they wish to trade or services they can provide. Visitors can browse these listings and connect with posters if interested in making a deal.

Please note that we were unable to finish the project during the event, but we did our utmost within the given time frame
